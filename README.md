**EASYSHOP ONLINE STORE**
~By Selam Nur
This project is a full backend online store with a frontend website to compliment it. The users are able to create an account where they can select from 90 different products. They can then add these products to their cart. You can also create and delete categories and products from the store.

-Here is the website where the user can log in, filter from minimum and maximum price, as well as colors.
-Users can also login to their account from the main page.

-When the user picks products they can go to their cart and show them what they selected. If the user chooses to, they can delete their cart and go back to the main screen

-Here, I signed out of the user account and signed into the admin.
-Since this is a different account, the cart has been cleared. Had the user have a product in their cart before they signed out, it would be there when they sign back in.
-The minimum and maximum price range works as expected and narrows the amount of products.

-When the admin is signed in, they can add a category when providing a name and a description for the new category
-The Category id is automatically generated.

-Here, in postman, you can search through all of the products in the store, regardless of the username

This is my interesting piece of code. I chose this because it challenged me to get a better understanding on the codebase and the relationship between the Shopping Cart class and the ShoppingCartItem class. This was the biggest hurdle in order to get the shopping cart to be functional.
